# ATS Resume Maker & Scoring System

An ATS-aware resume generation and scoring system that parses resumes, analyzes job descriptions, and produces optimized, ATS-friendly resume versions using NLP, LLMs, and rule-based heuristics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) often reject resumes due to poor keyword alignment and formatting issues.  
This project addresses that problem by building an end-to-end automation pipeline that:

- Parses unstructured resumes
- Extracts and analyzes job description requirements
- Scores resumes based on ATS heuristics
- Generates tailored, ATS-optimized resume versions

The system combines **rule-based NLP techniques** with **LLM-assisted tailoring** to improve resume relevance and ATS compatibility.
